X: a color
Y: another color
0: empty
iY: at current stage, segment number i can move
iN->(i-1)N->(i-2)Y: segment number i can't move, neither can segment (i-1), but segment (i-2) can move, so that is next in line to move. After this, all segments after (i-2) will be moved as close as possible to it.
