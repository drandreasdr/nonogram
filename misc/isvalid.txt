On strategies for investigating if a partially or fully uncovered configuration of a line is in agreement with the layout of the segments (the task of the method isvalid())


>Strategy 1:
Place seg 0 as early as possible, then seg 1 as early as possible after that, fill the rest with empty cells. If overlapping

Segs:
XX,Y,XX
Uncovered (obv not in agreement with segs: add one "-" for a conf that is):
----XXY-
Process of filling:
XX------ (first seg placed as early as possible)
XXY----- (second -||-)
XXY0XX-- (last seg moved up to avoid conflict with known conf)
XXY0XX00 (filling out the rest with empties)
now, since we've already placed our Y, we have a mismatch against the known conf. Thus, we can't know the answer to whether the uncovered conf is in agreement with the segment layout until we've tested all possible configurations.

Verdict Strategy 1:
+Doesn't assume anything about the known conf
-Requires testing all possible configurations to work

>Strategy 2:
Assume that the known conf represents the the initial part of the line (assert this?). Place seg 0 as early as possible (without conflict), then seg 1 etc. Return False as soon as there is a conflict (*) or if a segment falls outside of a line.
(*) Conflict is checked for at the range of blocks starting at the block after the last segment up to the last block of the current segment

Segs:
XX,Y,XX
Uncovered (and valid wrt segments):
00XX0Y--
Process of filling:
00XX----
00XX0Y--
00XX0YXX
thus valid

Uncovered (and NOT valid wrt segments):
00XX00Y-
Process of filling:
00XX----
00XX00Y-
not valid: next segment would fall outside of line

Uncovered (and NOT valid wrt segments):
00XX0YY-
Process of filling:
00XX0Y-- (fine, because of (*)) 
00XX0YXX (found a position for XX, but subsequent check fails)
not valid: conflict between last segment (and the empties before it (none in this case)) and uncovered conf.

Uncovered (and NOT valid wrt segments):
0000Y---
Process of filling:
00000XX-
not valid: conflict between last segment placed and the empties before it, and the uncovered conf.

Verdict Strategy 2:
+Doesn't require iterating over many configurations: requires only a small number of operations (<= line.length) per segment. Huge benefit in computational 
-Assumes that the uncovered conf is at the start of the line.
